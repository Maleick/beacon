![AutoShip — Turn backlog into reviewed PRs](../assets/autoship-banner.svg)

**Turn backlog into reviewed PRs.**
AutoShip is the OpenCode plugin for solo maintainers who want their GitHub issue queue planned, routed, verified, and packaged into pull requests without babysitting every worker.

## Core Behavior

- Plans `agent:ready` issues in ascending issue-number order
- Blocks unsafe/evasion-prone work for human review
- Uses `openai/gpt-5.5` for planner, coordinator, orchestrator, reviewer, and lead roles
- Selects worker models from the live `opencode models` inventory
- Defaults to currently available free worker models
- Allows operator-selected Spark, Go-provider, Nvidia, OpenRouter, and other OpenCode models when available
- Runs up to 15 active workers by default
