AutoShip is the multi-runtime plugin for solo maintainers who want their GitHub issue queue planned, routed, verified, and packaged into pull requests without babysitting every worker.

## What It Does

- Reads open GitHub issues labeled `agent:ready` (OpenCode and Hermes)
- Plans work in ascending issue-number order
- Dispatches **OpenCode** workers up to 15 concurrent
- Dispatches **Hermes** subagents up to 3 concurrent via cronjobs
- Verifies completed work before PR creation
- Creates PRs with conventional commit titles
- Tracks local state in `.autoship/`

## Installation

To have OpenCode fetch install instructions directly, tell OpenCode:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maleick/AutoShip/refs/tags/v2.2.1/INSTALL.md
```

Install the CLI globally if you want AutoShip available long-term on your PATH:

```bash
npm install -g opencode-autoship
opencode-autoship install
opencode-autoship doctor
```

For a one-time install without keeping a global CLI, use `bunx` instead:

```bash
bunx opencode-autoship install
bunx opencode-autoship doctor
```

Then start the setup wizard inside OpenCode:

```text
/autoship-setup
```

See [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) for prerequisites, verification, updating, and troubleshooting.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI globally
npm install -g opencode-autoship

# 2. Install AutoShip for OpenCode
opencode-autoship install
opencode-autoship doctor

# 3. Navigate to your project
cd ~/Projects/my-project

# 4. Configure the target repo in OpenCode
/autoship-setup

# 5. Start AutoShip in OpenCode
/autoship
```

## Runtime

AutoShip supports **two worker runtimes**:

### OpenCode (Primary)
OpenCode is the primary supported worker runtime. AutoShip discovers current model availability from:

```bash
opencode models
```

Setup defaults to ranked free worker models from the current OpenCode inventory. On first run, the setup wizard asks which models to use for the orchestrator and reviewer roles; these can be the same model or different models. Operators can explicitly select a comma-separated worker model list with `AUTOSHIP_MODELS`.

The selected routing is saved to `.autoship/model-routing.json`. Edit that file manually to tune model eligibility, strength, or task types. Setup preserves manual edits by default; use `AUTOSHIP_REFRESH_MODELS=1 bash hooks/opencode/setup.sh` to regenerate from the current OpenCode inventory.

### Hermes (Secondary)
Hermes is supported as an alternative runtime for autonomous cron-based burn-down. Hermes uses the provider and model configured in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` and dispatches work via `cronjob` or `delegate_task`.

```bash
# Setup Hermes runtime
bash hooks/hermes/setup.sh

# Plan issues for Hermes
bash hooks/hermes/plan-issues.sh

# Dispatch an issue to Hermes
bash hooks/hermes/dispatch.sh <issue-number>
```

Hermes-specific configuration:
- **Max concurrent**: 3 (Hermes subagent limit)
- **Target label**: `agent:ready`
- **Dispatch method**: Cronjob with 15-minute intervals
- **Worktrees**: Created in `.autoship/workspaces/issue-<number>/`

AutoShip also loads committed policy profiles from `policies/`. Policies enrich worker prompts, configure Rust cargo safeguards, guide overlap-aware dispatch, and enforce repo-specific hazards such as self-hosted GitHub Actions runners.

## Defaults

- **OpenCode** max active workers: `15`
- **Hermes** max active workers: `3` (subagent limit)
- Queue ordering: lowest issue number first
- Model routing (OpenCode): ranked free OpenCode models first, with deterministic rotation across compatible workers
- Model routing (Hermes): inherits from `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, no per-issue selection
- Role selection: best available role model from `opencode models`, preferring free models first, then OpenCode Go models; paid Zen/OpenRouter Kimi models require explicit selection
- Free detection: `:free`/`-free` IDs and bundled free Zen models such as `opencode/big-pickle` and `opencode/gpt-5-nano`
- Go routing: `opencode-go/*` models are included as low-cost subscription fallback models, not free models
- Orchestrator/reviewer: prompted during first-run setup and configurable independently
- Worker selection: free-first compatible model per task, with selected fallbacks eligible when configured
- Complex fallback: if no sufficiently strong compatible worker is available, AutoShip uses the configured orchestrator model as an advisor

## Local Testing

```bash
bash hooks/opencode/test-policy.sh
bash -n hooks/opencode/*.sh hooks/*.sh
bash hooks/opencode/smoke-test.sh
```

## Release

Package publish steps are documented in [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md).

## Troubleshooting

Run diagnostics first:

```bash
opencode-autoship doctor
```

If checks fail, reinstall the package assets and rerun setup:

```bash
opencode-autoship install
```

```text
/autoship-setup
```

## Runtime Artifacts

`.autoship/` contains local runtime state and workspaces. Do not commit it.
