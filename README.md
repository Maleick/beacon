# Beacon: Autonomous Multi-Agent GitHub Orchestration

**Beacon** is a Claude Code plugin that autonomously dispatches AI agents to resolve GitHub issues — routing work to Codex, Gemini, or Claude based on complexity and quota, verifying results, and merging PRs with zero human intervention.

## How It Works

Beacon runs a four-tier orchestration loop inside Claude Code:

1. **Monitor** — Three bash watchers poll GitHub issues (60s), PR status (30s), and agent completion (5s) via the Monitor tool
2. **Triage** — Claude Haiku interprets events and writes prioritized actions to an event queue
3. **Execute** — Claude Sonnet consumes the queue, dispatches agents to isolated git worktrees, and drives the verification pipeline
4. **Advise** — Claude Opus is spawned only at strategic decision points (UltraPlan, phase checkpoints, repeated failures)

```
GitHub Issues → Monitor Scripts → Haiku Triage → Sonnet Executor → Opus Advisor
                     ↑                                  ↓
              PR/CI/agent events           Codex · Gemini · Grok · Claude agents
                                                         ↓
                                          Verify → Simplify → PR → Merge
```

## Key Features

**Third-party first dispatch.** Beacon routes simple and medium issues to Codex, Gemini, or Grok before burning Claude quota. Claude Haiku and Sonnet serve as reliable fallbacks, with Opus reserved for strategic decisions only.

**Worktree isolation.** Each issue gets its own git worktree and tmux pane. Agents work concurrently without stepping on each other. Completion is detected via structured status words (`COMPLETE`, `BLOCKED`, `STUCK`) captured in pane logs — no polling required.

**Tiered escalation.** Haiku handles simple issues (2-3 files). On failure, it retries once with context, then auto-promotes to Sonnet. Sonnet escalates to Opus after two failures. PR comments are triaged the same way: Haiku fixes nits, Sonnet handles bugs, Opus handles design escalations.

**Verification pipeline.** Every completed issue runs through: Sonnet review against acceptance criteria → simplify pass → PR creation → CI monitoring → auto-merge (simple) or human review gate (complex).

**Discord integration.** Webhook events trigger issue dispatch in real time. A command channel accepts operator commands (`work on`, `skip`, `pause`, `resume`) without leaving Discord.

**Quota tracking.** A decay-based quota estimator updates `quota.json` after each dispatch and surfaces usage in `/beacon status` as ASCII progress bars.

## Installation

Requires Claude Code with plugin support.

```bash
# Install via plugin marketplace
/install-plugin https://github.com/maleick/beacon

# Or install locally during development
/install-plugin /path/to/beacon
```

**Prerequisites:**

- `jq` — `brew install jq`
- `gh` — GitHub CLI, authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- At least one AI CLI tool: `codex`, `gemini`, or `grok` (optional but recommended for quota efficiency)

## Commands

| Command          | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/beacon start`  | Launch orchestration for the current repo                   |
| `/beacon status` | Show running agents, quota bars, and progress               |
| `/beacon stop`   | Gracefully stop all agents                                  |
| `/beacon plan`   | Analyze issues and build execution plan without dispatching |

| Worker (simple)  | Haiku / Codex / Gemini | 1-3 file changes                                            |
| Worker (medium)  | Sonnet / Gemini Pro    | Multi-file, moderate complexity                             |
| Worker (complex) | Sonnet + autoresearch  | Cross-cutting, architectural                                |
| Triage           | Haiku                  | Every Monitor event                                         |
| Reviewer         | Sonnet                 | Post-completion verification                                |

State persists in `.beacon/state.json` (local) and GitHub labels (durable across sessions).

## Design Decisions

Eleven v3 design decisions are documented in [wiki/Design-Decisions.md](wiki/Design-Decisions.md). Key choices:

- **Sonnet as executor, not Opus** — Opus is expensive; Sonnet handles reactive event processing at scale
- **Monitor over CronCreate** — Monitor tool streams events; cron polling misses rapid state changes
- **Status words over pane_dead** — `COMPLETE`/`BLOCKED`/`STUCK` are reliable; pane death is ambiguous
- **Third-party first** — Preserving Claude Max quota for complex work extends daily capacity significantly

See [BEACON_SPEC.md](BEACON_SPEC.md) for the full specification and [wiki/Architecture.md](wiki/Architecture.md) for the complete four-tier model.
