# Beacon Dispatch Protocol — v3

Third-party tools (Codex/Gemini) are dispatched first for simple and medium issues to maximize external quota usage. Claude agents are reserved for complex work and fallback.

---

## Dispatch Priority Matrix

| Complexity | Primary                       | Fallback                      | Last Resort              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Simple     | Codex-Spark/GPT (quota > 10%) | Gemini (quota > 10%) → Haiku  | Claude Haiku (rate-lim)  |
| Medium     | Codex-Spark/GPT (quota > 10%) | Gemini (quota > 10%) → Sonnet | Claude Sonnet (rate-lim) |
| Complex    | Claude Sonnet + autoresearch  | Claude Sonnet (retry)         | Opus advisor: re-slice   |

# TODO: Grok support pending CLI detection

Check quota before dispatch:

```bash
# Refresh daily quota estimates (auto-resets if crossed midnight)
bash hooks/quota-update.sh refresh

# Read current quota estimates
bash hooks/quota-update.sh check
```

**Quota thresholds:**

- `quota_pct == -1` → unknown, treat as available
- `quota_pct > 10` → available, dispatch normally
- `0 < quota_pct <= 10` → warn Opus advisor before dispatching (QUOTA_LOW)
- `quota_pct == 0` → exhausted, skip tool entirely

```bash
# Check for low-quota tools before choosing (example for codex-spark)
SPARK_Q=$(jq '.["codex-spark"].quota_pct' .beacon/quota.json 2>/dev/null || echo 100)
if (( SPARK_Q == 0 )); then
  # Skip codex-spark, try next tool
  :
elif (( SPARK_Q <= 10 && SPARK_Q != -1 )); then
  # Log warning but proceed — operator can override
  echo "QUOTA_LOW codex-spark (${SPARK_Q}%)" >> .beacon/poll.log
fi
```

---

## Step 0: Verify Tmux Layout

The Beacon session uses a fixed two-column layout:

- **Pane 0 (left, 30% width)**: Sonnet executor (main orchestrator) — created at startup, not managed here
- **Pane 1+ (right, 70% width)**: Agent panes, tiled vertically

On first agent spawn, initialize the layout if it hasn't been set:

```bash
# Check if layout already set (only 1 pane means orchestrator hasn't split yet)
pane_count=$(tmux list-panes -t beacon | wc -l)
if (( pane_count == 1 )); then
  # Split main pane into left (orchestrator) and right (agents) regions
  tmux split-window -t beacon:0.0 -h -p 70
fi
```

This only runs once — subsequent agents spawn into the right column via `split-window -t beacon`.

---

## Step 1: Create Worktree

```bash
ISSUE_KEY="issue-<number>"
git worktree add .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY -b beacon/$ISSUE_KEY main
```

**If branch already exists (previous attempt):**

```bash
git worktree remove .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY --force 2>/dev/null
git branch -D beacon/$ISSUE_KEY 2>/dev/null
git worktree add .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY -b beacon/$ISSUE_KEY main
```

**If disk/lock failure:** Mark issue blocked, skip to next.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Pane Log (for real-time completion detection)

Before spawning any tmux-based agent, create the pane log file:

```bash
mkdir -p .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY
touch .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY/pane.log
```

After spawning the pane, attach pipe-pane:

```bash
tmux pipe-pane -t $PANE_ID "cat >> .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY/pane.log"
```

Monitor 1 watches these log files for `COMPLETE`, `BLOCKED`, or `STUCK` on their own line.

---

## Step 2B: Pre-Dispatch Exhaustion Gate

Before assigning an agent, check the `exhausted` flag in `.beacon/quota.json`. This prevents dispatching to a tool that has already reported quota exhaustion — even if quota_pct is stale.

```bash
# Re-run detect-tools.sh every 5 dispatches to refresh quota estimates
DISPATCH_COUNT=$(jq -r '.dispatch_count // 0' .beacon/state.json)
if (( DISPATCH_COUNT % 5 == 0 && DISPATCH_COUNT > 0 )); then
  bash hooks/detect-tools.sh
fi

# Before assigning agent, check exhausted flag
# Iterate through the priority list for this complexity tier:
for AGENT in "${PRIORITY_LIST[@]}"; do
  EXHAUSTED=$(jq -r --arg t "$AGENT" '.[$t].exhausted // false' .beacon/quota.json)
  if [[ "$EXHAUSTED" == "true" ]]; then
    # Fall through to next agent in priority list
    continue
  fi
  # Agent is not exhausted — proceed with this agent
  SELECTED_AGENT="$AGENT"
  break
done

if [[ -z "$SELECTED_AGENT" ]]; then
  echo "All agents in priority list exhausted — escalate to Opus advisor"
  # Mark issue BLOCKED and notify
fi
```

**Rules:**

- `exhausted: true` in quota.json → skip that agent entirely, try next in priority list
- Re-run `hooks/detect-tools.sh` every 5 dispatches to refresh quota estimates
- If all priority agents are exhausted, mark the issue `BLOCKED` and escalate to the Opus advisor
- After `detect-tools.sh` refreshes quota, an agent previously marked exhausted may become available again

---

## Step 3A: Dispatch Third-Party Agent (Codex/Gemini)

Write the prompt file:

```bash
cat > .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY/BEACON_PROMPT.md << 'EOF'
Implement the following GitHub issue in this repository.

## Issue: #<number> — <title>

<full issue body>

## Acceptance Criteria

<parsed from issue body, or generated from description>

## Instructions

- Run tests after changes: `<test-command>`
- Work only in the scope of this issue
- Commit your changes to the current branch
- Do NOT push, merge, or close the issue

## When Finished

Write `BEACON_RESULT.md` to the current working directory (the worktree root).
Do not write to the parent repository. The expected path is:
`.beacon/workspaces/<issue-key>/BEACON_RESULT.md`

```

# Result: #<number> — <title>

## Status: DONE | PARTIAL | STUCK

## Changes Made

- <file>: <what changed and why>

## Tests

- Command: `<test-command>`
- Result: PASS | FAIL
- New tests added: yes/no

## Notes

<anything the reviewer should know>
```

When done, print exactly one of these words on its own line as your final output:
COMPLETE
BLOCKED
STUCK
EOF

````

Spawn tmux pane:

```bash
PANE_ID=$(tmux split-window -t beacon -c .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY -P -F '#{pane_id}')
tmux select-layout -t beacon tiled
tmux select-pane -t $PANE_ID -T "<TOOL>: $ISSUE_KEY"
tmux pipe-pane -t $PANE_ID "cat >> .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY/pane.log"
````

Send command:

```bash
# Codex — use --prompt-file to avoid shell injection from issue body content
tmux send-keys -t $PANE_ID "codex --prompt-file BEACON_PROMPT.md --auto-edit; for i in \$(seq 1 5); do [[ -f BEACON_RESULT.md ]] && break; sleep 1; done; [[ -f BEACON_RESULT.md ]] && echo COMPLETE || echo STUCK" Enter

# Gemini — no native file flag; write a wrapper script and execute it instead
cat > .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY/run-agent.sh << 'WRAPPER'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
gemini --prompt-file BEACON_PROMPT.md
for i in $(seq 1 5); do
  [[ -f BEACON_RESULT.md ]] && break
  sleep 1
done
[[ -f BEACON_RESULT.md ]] && echo COMPLETE || echo STUCK
WRAPPER
chmod +x .beacon/workspaces/$ISSUE_KEY/run-agent.sh
tmux send-keys -t $PANE_ID "bash run-agent.sh" Enter
```

Never inline file contents into shell strings. Always use a file flag or wrapper script to avoid shell metacharacter injection from issue bodies.

Update state and decrement quota:

```bash
bash hooks/update-state.sh set-running <issue-id> agent=codex-spark pane_id=$PANE_ID
# Decrement estimated quota for the tool actually dispatched (use actual tool name)
bash hooks/quota-update.sh decrement codex-spark <complexity>   # simple | medium | complex
# bash hooks/quota-update.sh decrement codex-gpt <complexity>   # if GPT model used
# bash hooks/quota-update.sh decrement gemini <complexity>      # if Gemini dispatched
```

**Completion detection for third-party agents:**

- Monitor 1 tails `pane.log` for `COMPLETE`, `BLOCKED`, or `STUCK`
- As backup: if `pane_dead=1` and `BEACON_RESULT.md` exists → treat as COMPLETE
- If `pane_dead=1` and no `BEACON_RESULT.md` → crash, re-dispatch

---

## Pane Reuse After Agent Completion

When an agent emits `COMPLETE`, `BLOCKED`, or `STUCK`, its pane should be killed to free grid space. Full cleanup (worktree removal, branch deletion, issue close) is handled by `hooks/cleanup-worktree.sh`. The tmux pane teardown is:

```bash
# After agent completes, kill its pane to free the grid
tmux kill-pane -t $PANE_ID 2>/dev/null || true
# Re-tile remaining panes
tmux select-layout -t beacon tiled
```

This is called by `hooks/cleanup-worktree.sh` after state is updated — do not call it directly from the dispatch protocol.

---

## Tmux Status Line

The status line updates **only on agent checkin** (COMPLETE/BLOCKED/STUCK detected in a `pane.log`), not on every poll event. Updating on every Monitor tick creates visual noise and unnecessary writes.

```bash
# Update tmux status line with current agent count — only on agent checkin
ACTIVE=$(jq '[.issues | to_entries[] | select(.value.state == "running")] | length' .beacon/state.json)
tmux set-option -t beacon status-right "Beacon: ${ACTIVE} active | $(date +%H:%M)"
```

Call this snippet from the Monitor 1 handler after processing a checkin event, not from the poll loop.

---

## 20+ Pane Handling

`select-layout tiled` handles up to ~30 panes on a typical screen. Beyond 20 agent panes the tiles become too small to read. Switch the agent column to `even-vertical` at that threshold:

```bash
# For > 20 agent panes, switch to even-vertical within the agent column
agent_count=$(tmux list-panes -t beacon | wc -l)
if (( agent_count > 20 )); then
  tmux select-layout -t beacon even-vertical
else
  tmux select-layout -t beacon tiled
fi
```

This check runs after every `split-window` call in Step 3A.

## Step 3B: Dispatch Claude Haiku Agent (Simple)

Use TeamCreate for visibility:

```
TeamCreate({
  name: "beacon-<issue-key>",
  teammateMode: "auto"
})
```

  ```
  ## Previous Attempt Failed
  Reviewer verdict: FAIL
  Issues found: <SPECIFIC_ISSUES from reviewer output>
  Please address these specifically.
  ```
- **Attempt 2 fail**: Automatically escalate to Sonnet — no Opus consultation needed
- **Attempt 3+ fail (Sonnet)**: Spawn Opus advisor

Update attempt count in state:

```bash
bash hooks/update-state.sh set-running <issue-id> attempt=<N>
```
